It comes from the tv show The Big Bang theory and gives a new take on the game with a larger selection to choose from.

## Usage

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is for people who want to play a bigger version of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock and for people who enjoy The Big Bang Theory and want to play their take of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

The game was built for mobile usage firstly as most people use their phones to play games like this rather than a computer/laptop.

## Design

I went for a design that the colours contrasts quite well and is easy on the eyes to look at.
I thought a simple design was perfect for a simple game.
